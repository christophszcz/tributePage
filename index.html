	          <h3 class="subtitle">Here's a timeline of Gandhi's life:</h3>
	      
	          <ul>
	            <li><b>1869</b> Born in Porbandar, Kathiawar Agency, British India.</li> 
	            <li><b>1891</b> Passed his bar in the U.K. and became a lawyer.</li>
	            <li><b>1893</b> He is thrown off of a train after refusing to give up his fairly purchased first class seat.</li>
	            <li><b>1894</b> Gandhi establishes the Natal Indian Congress in opposition to a bill denying Indians the ability to vote in South Africa. </li>
	            <li><b>1908</b> Gandhi and a large cohort of Indians burn their unjust registration cards as a sign of  protest in Johannesburg. </li>
	            <li><b>1920</b> He gets people to boycott British products & manufacture their own. </li>
	            <li><b>1930</b> The British make it illegal for Indians to make their own salt. Gandhi & his followers   travel to Dandi to make their own own. As a result, he is imprisoned.
	            <li><b>1942</b> He is imprisoned for launching the "Quit India" campaign declaring India’s self-government from British rule.</li>
	            <li><b>1943</b> Gandhi starts a hunger strike which continues for 21 days.</li>
	            <li><b>1948</b> January 12 –  Asking for payment to be made to Pakistan and conflict to cease, Gandhi starts another fast. 5 days into the fast, India makes payment to Pakistan. In addition Hindu, Muslim & Sikh community leaders agree to peace.</li>
	            <li><b>1948</b> January 30 – Gandhi was shot and killed by a member of a Hindu organization enraged by Gandhi’s peacemaking campaigns.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <blockquote>
	            <p> “I believe that Gandhi’s views were the most enlightened of all the political men in our time. We should strive to do things in his spirit: not to use violence in fighting for our cause, but by non-participation in anything you believe is evil.”</p>
